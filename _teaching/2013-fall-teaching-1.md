CS 111: Introduction to Computer Science I at Gettysburg College is a foundational course in computer science, often referred to as a "CS1" course. It serves as the initial programming course for computer science majors and other students interested in developing programming skills.

## Course Overview

- Introduces programming fundamentals and develops algorithmic thinking skills
- Taught using the Java programming language
- Offered each semester, making it accessible for students to begin the CS major

## Key Topics

- Basic computing concepts
- Data types
- Classes and objects
- Control structures
- Methods and parameters
- Arrays and ArrayLists

## Course Objectives

Students who complete CS 111 should be able to:

- Design and implement programs using object-oriented principles
- Understand and apply fundamental programming constructs
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithmic thinking
- Create and use simple data structures

## Significance

CS 111 is a crucial first step for prospective CS majors, typically taken in the first year along with CS 112 and Math 111. It provides the foundation for more advanced courses in the computer science curriculum[1].

## Additional Notes

- Students with AP Computer Science scores of 4 or 5 can receive credit for CS 111 and place directly into CS 112
- The course may have lab components where students apply concepts through practical programming exercises
- Success in CS 111 is vital for progression in the CS major, as it leads to CS 112 and eventually CS 216 (Data Structures)[1]

CS 111 is designed to give students a solid grounding in programming and computational thinking, preparing them for more advanced study in computer science.
