### COVID-19 Case and Vaccine Forecasting at the County-Level for Virginia

Developed a model at the city and county level of Virginia that gives a short-term forecast for the total number of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 vaccines administered and supplied. Available at: https://vmasc.shinyapps.io/va-county-covid-forecast/. 
* Provides a 7-day forecast for the number of COVID-19 cases and a 21-day forecast for the COVID-19 vaccines administered and supplied.
* Case forecast for the city/county estimates the age range of individuals with COVID-19 and what their case outcomes are expected to be. 
* Attempts to identify tweets from individuals within the city/county that are reporting having COVID-19. 
* Designed to be as transparent as possible: for each forecast or piece of insight it provides it tries to describe the methodology behind how it came to that prediction in a straightforward way. 
* Has used by the Virginia Department of Health, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management and has over 1,000 different unique users from the public across 75 different cities or counties within Virginia.

## Leveraging Public Behavior to better understand human behavior 

### You Are What You Tweet
We studied the relationship among the obesity rate of urban areas and expressions of happiness, diet and physical activity on social media. We showed that areas with lower obesity rates: (1) have happier tweets and frequently discuss (2) food, particularly fruits and vegetables, and (3) physical activities of any intensity.

### Characterizing the Mobile Phone Use Patterns of Refugee-Hosting Provinces in Turkey

We used an anomyized mobile phone data set to understand the experience of refugees throughout Turkey based on their proximity to refugee targeted violent incidents and refugee camps. We showed that: (1) there is more negative sentiment targeted expressed towards refugees in those areas close to refugee camps and (2) the mobile phone behavior (i.e. number of calls made and text messages sent) in the wake of a violent incident for refugees and non-refugees is more similar the close the individuals are to the location of the incident.
