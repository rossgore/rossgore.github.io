## COVID-19 Case and Vaccine Forecasting

 Developed a model at the city and county level of Virginia that gives a short-term forecast for the total number of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 vaccines administered and supplied. Available at: [https://vmasc.shinyapps.io/va-county-covid-forecast/](https://vmasc.shinyapps.io/va-county-covid-forecast/).
    
-   Provides a 7-day forecast for the number of COVID-19 cases and a 21-day forecast for the COVID-19 vaccines administered and supplied.
    
 -   Case forecast for the city/county estimates the age range of individuals with COVID-19 and what their case outcomes are expected to be.
     
-   Attempts to identify tweets from individuals within the city/county that are reporting having COVID-19.
    
-   Designed to be as transparent as possible: for each forecast or piece of insight it provides it tries to describe the methodology behind how it came to that prediction in a straightforward way.
    
-   Has used by the Virginia Department of Health, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management and has over 1,000 different unique users from the public across 75 different cities or counties within Virginia.

## Leveraging Data To Better Understand Humanity

A major focus of my research is leveraging data that is an artifact of the way we live to better understand human behavior. Typically, this data takes the form of social media data, anomyized GPS mobility data, and anomyized SMS messages and cell phone records. My aim is to novel insight about human behavior by quantifying and analyzing these data sources.
    
### You Are What You Tweet

We studied the relationship among the obesity rate of urban areas and expressions of happiness, diet and physical activity on social media. We showed that areas with lower obesity rates: (1) have happier tweets and frequently discuss (2) food, particularly fruits and vegetables, and (3) physical activities of any intensity.

### Understanding How Locals And Tourists React Differently To City Attractions

We studied how the time of day and if individuals were locals or tourists can affect the sentiment individuals express towards attractions. We showed that: (1) tourists express more positive sentiment towards attractions than locals and (2) more positive sentiment is expressed about attractions in the morning vs. the afternoon / evening.

### Characterizing The Mobile Phone Use Patterns Of Refugee Hosting Provinces In Turkey

We used an anomyized mobile phone data set to understand the experience of refugees throughout Turkey based on their proximity to refugee targeted violent incidents and refugee camps. We showed that: (1) there is more negative sentiment targeted expressed towards refugees in those areas close to refugee camps and (2) the mobile phone behavior (i.e. number of calls made and text messages sent) in the wake of a violent incident for refugees and non-refugees is more similar the close the individuals are to the location of the incident. The research won the "Safety and Security Prize" in the Data For Refugees (D4R) challenge sponsored by Turk Telecom.

### Mobile Data As A Public Health Decision Enabler

We used [anomyized cell-phone data](/D4D_Senegal.pdf) from Senegal provided by the Data For Development challenge and joined with with demographic data and the location of hospitals to identify those areas in the country where adding an additional hospital would most reduce the travel time during the critical initial period for patients experiencing an heart attack or stroke.

### Modeling Human Behavior With Agent Based Models

They are diverse in their knowledge and abilities but their behavior is far from random. However, despite often making rational decisions, their behavior is also emotional. My research with agent-based models has attempted to capture these attributes, when they matter, to better understand how humans operate and how the institutions around them operate in a variety of domains.

## Simulation Debugging, Validation And Verification

The process of developing, verifying and validating models and simulations should be straightforward. Unfortunately, following conventional development approaches can render a model design that appeared complete and robust into an incomplete, incoherent and invalid simulation during implementation. An alternative approach is for subject matter experts (SMEs) to employ formal methods to describe their models. However, formal methods are rarely used in practice due to their intimidating syntax and semantics rooted in mathematics.
    
To address this problem I have developed an approach to gaining insight about unexpected outputs, in some cases bugs, centered around the practice of predicate-based statistical debugging used in software engineering. This approach is realized in a standalone tool published on my [Github](https://github.com/rossgore/IVandVLevelChecker) and in an [online web application](https://vmasc.shinyapps.io/VandVCalculator/). We have a small but regular user base (~25-50 users) and we are always looking to grow it.
