In this paper, we propose an approach to formally verify and rigorously validate a simulation system against the specification of the real system. We implement the approach in a verification and validation calculator tool that takes as input a set of statements that capture the requirements, internal conditions of the system and expected outputs of the real system and produces as output whether the simulation satisfies the requirements, faithfully represents the internal conditions of the system and produces the expected outputs. We provide a use case to show how subject matter experts can apply the tool.
