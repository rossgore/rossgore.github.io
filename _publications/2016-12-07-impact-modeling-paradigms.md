We explore the impact of using different modeling paradigms on the outcome of simulation studies. Modeling paradigms, once implemented, follow different computational rules regarding how calculations are made and are sequenced during runtime. To test the effects of computational differences on a simulation's outcomes, we implement a simple queuing system as a Discrete Event Simulation model, a System Dynamics model, an Agent-based Model, and a Multi-paradigm Model. Our findings show that paradigm selection does play a role in the generation of outcomes, as the System Dynamics model produces a significantly different set of outcomes than the other models for the selected output variables. This paper serves as a first step in examining how the selection of a paradigm affects the outcome of the simulation.
