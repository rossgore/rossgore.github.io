Over the past six decades, Modeling and Simulation (M&S) has been used as a method or tool in many disciplines. While there is no doubt that the emergence of modern M&S is highly connected with that of Computing and Systems science, there is no clear evidence of the contribution of M&S to those disciplines. Further, while there is a growing body of knowledge (BoK) in M&S, there is no easy way to identify it due to the multidisciplinary nature of M&S. In this paper, we examine whether M&S is its own discipline by performing content analysis of a BoK in Computer Science. Content analysis is a research methodology that aims to identify key concepts and relationships in a body of text through computational means. It can be applied to research articles in a BoK to identify the prominent topics and themes.
