This paper presents an initial baseline model of factors that give rise to an attacker. It explores the impact of successful rate of attack and social learning on the decision to become an attacker. The model utilizes rational choice theory, routine activity theory, social learning theory, and perceived behavioral control from the theory of planned behavior to examine factors that moves an individual from user to attacker. An agent-based model is used to depict the effect of interactions of users and attacks of all users, successful and unsuccessful, have on an individualâ€™s decision to become an attacker. Preliminary results suggest that opportunity has a stronger influence than the rate of successful attacks or the size of the associated group.
