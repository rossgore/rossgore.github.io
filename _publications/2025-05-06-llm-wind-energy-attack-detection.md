excerpt: 'This paper presents Bassa-Llama, a specialized platform for real-time network attack detection primarily focused on wind energy power plants. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of Meta's Llama large language model, Bassa-Llama has been refined through fine-tuning specifically for anomaly detection within complex, interconnected networks. The platform utilizes blockchain and NFT technology to establish secure and verified threat analysis, allowing for rapid, transparent investigations of security incidents. Unlike traditional methods, Bassa-Llama’s decentralized approach enables real-Time Network Attack Detection – proactively identifying vulnerabilities before they escalate.'
