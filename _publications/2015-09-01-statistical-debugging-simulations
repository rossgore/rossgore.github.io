Predictions from simulations have entered the mainstream of public policy and decision-making practices. Unfortunately, methods for gaining insight into faulty simulations outputs have not kept pace. Ideally, an insight gathering method would automatically identify the cause of a faulty output and explain to the simulation developer how to correct it. In the field of software engineering, this challenge has been addressed for general-purpose software through statistical debuggers. We present two research contributions, elastic predicates and many-valued labeling functions, that enable debuggers designed for general-purpose software to become more effective for simulations employing random variates and continuous numbers. Elastic predicates address deficiencies of existing debuggers related to continuous numbers, whereas many-valued labeling functions support the use of random variates.
