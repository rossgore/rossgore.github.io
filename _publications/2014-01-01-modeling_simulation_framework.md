In many application domains (military, homeland security, health care, and business), modeling and simulation (M&S) has become a standard approach for systematically developing, testing, and acquiring systems. The use of M&S usually involves three major steps:(1) identifying user requirements to capture stakeholders’ needs,(2) conceptual modeling to capture system’s parts and relationships, and (3) verification and validation (V&V) to evaluate the accuracy, correctness, and credibility of the simulation (Balci 1994; Balci 1998). Although these activities are supported successfully in systems engineering (SE) through standard processes, a formal (in the mathematical sense) process that ties in all SE activities has not been formulated.
