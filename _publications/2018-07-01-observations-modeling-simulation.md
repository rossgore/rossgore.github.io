This paper reports on a survey capturing modelersâ€™ perspectives of Modeling and Simulation (M&S). The survey was completed by a total of 283 respondents from the M&S community with 167 fully completed surveys and 151 respondents identified as model builders. Participants include people from government, academia, and industry in varied roles ranging from researchers to business developers. Respondents also represent a diverse educational background ranging from oceanography, social sciences, and engineering. The survey focuses on three dimensions namely: (a) models and simulations, (b) participants, and (c) how participants interact with models/simulations.
