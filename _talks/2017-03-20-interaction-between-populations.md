This talk addresses the challenges and strategies involved in effectively using smaller datasets for modeling purposes. It explores various techniques to overcome common issues such as overfitting and lack of generalization, which are prevalent when working with limited data. The presentation covers methods like transfer learning, data augmentation, and ensemble learning to enhance model performance. Additionally, it discusses the importance of selecting appropriate modeling algorithms and feature selection techniques to maximize the utility of small data in fields where large datasets are not available.
