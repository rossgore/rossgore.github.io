This talk explores how the integration of big data analytics can provide fresh perspectives on religious beliefs and practices by analyzing vast datasets from sources like social media, surveys, and online forums. This approach allows researchers to track shifts in religious behavior over time, identify emerging trends such as the rise of spiritual but non-religious identities, and understand the evolving role of religion in contemporary society
