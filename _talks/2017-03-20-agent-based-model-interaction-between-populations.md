This talk explores the dynamics between immigrant groups and host communities using agent-based modeling (ABM) techniques. This approach simulates interactions at the individual level to observe emergent patterns and outcomes at the population level. The model incorporates various factors influencing these interactions, such as cultural differences, economic opportunities, social networks, and policy environments.
