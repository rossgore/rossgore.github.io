This talk describes how changes in input variables affect the outputs of a simulation model, helping to validate and improve the model's accuracy and robustness. This process typically employsglobal sensitivity analysis to identify critical factors that influence model behavior, allowing for better decision-making and optimization of systems across various fields.
