This is Dr. Ross Gore's home on the web. My research focuses on extracting, combining, and analyzing data from new and diverse sources to provide quantitative and interpretable answers to questions. This analysis can take the form of analysis, statistical models or simulations. The domains of the questions have varied from public health, refugee migration, city planning, terrorist attack risk assessments, cyber security, software engineering and social science. The unifying theme across my work is the use of novel data sources to improve understanding of the problem at hand.
