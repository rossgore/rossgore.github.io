Education
======
* Ph.D in Computer Science, University of Virginia, 2012
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Virginia, 2007
* B.S. in Computer Science, University of Richmond, 2003

Work experience
======
* Spring 2022: Research Associate Professor
  * Old Dominion University | Office of Enterprise Research and Innovation | Center for Secure and Intelligent Critical Systems

* Summer 2014: Research Assistant Professor
  * Old Dominion University | Virginia Modeling Analysis and Simulation Center

- Lead research on data science and predictive analytics in areas ranging including the obesity epidemic in the USA, improving risk communication, and religiosity and extremism in the Middle East. In total this work has yielded $698,869 ($330,130 of Credit) in externally funded research with me serving as principal investigator.

- Co-led research by extracting useful information from new and diverse data sources to help inform decision making in domains from cyber security (understanding Advanced Persistent Cyber Threats), medical (studying the efficacy of game-based training for critical care personnel in the armed forces), emergency services (providing risk analysis for bioterror threats) and Department of Defense (DoD) applications (developing algorithms to effective search databases to facilitate the United States Navy establishing internal partnering agreements with ally nations). In total with work has yielded $6,050,108 ($1,113,127 of Credit) in externally funded research as co-principal investigator.

- Conduct research on simulation validation and debugging. Support simulation platforms are testing grounds for these methods with partial funding from principal investigator and co-principal investigator efforts (7 journal publications, 14 peer-reviewed conference papers and 3 book chapters).

* Summer 2013: Visiting Assistant Professor
  * Gettysburg College | Department of Computer Science
- Taught computer science courses and supervise research for undergraduate students (3 courses covering 6 section taught, 2 undergraduate research projects supervised).

* Summer 2012: Post Doctoral Research Associate
  * Old Dominion University | Virginia Modeling Analysis and Simulation Center
  
- Researched composability, interoperability, debugging, verification and validation supporting ongoing funded projects. 

- Developed software to facilitate simulation debugging verification and validation used extensively on funded projects.

- Researched the epistemological nature of modeling and simulation.
