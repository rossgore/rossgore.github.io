While teaching is not part of my duties as a research faculty, I engage in teaching at as often as I can. As part of two research grants I am co-principle investigator on, I teach data analytics courses on data science and predictive analytics at the Navyâ€™s four different publicly owned shipyards. These courses are designed specifically for the shipyards and their requirements enabling them to explore data, look for patterns, identify efficiencies and improvements that can be made. I have had a lead role in developing the curriculum for the courses and traveling on site to teach the courses. In particular I have focused on determining the most effective way to teach complex topics like artificial intelligence and deep learning in a way so that students can understand when and how to effectively use these analytic methods in their day to day workflow but also understand the assumptions and pitfalls that can be associated with them.

### Working With Graduate Students

In addition, throughout my work on research projects and in my everyday interactions with other ODU faculty, project scientists, graduate students and undergraduate students I have adopted a philosophy that improves them and me. I treat each of these interactions as a dual-sided teachable moment that can help me learn how to better meet the needs of others at our university. In particular, working at multi-disciplinary research center like VMASC, I have learned and now emphasize that different perspectives yield innovation. Knowledge of many subject areas provides a cross fertilization of ideas that frequently leads to innovation. "Eureka" moments are the product of our unconscious minds working on a problem, using previously studied materials and methods. My research projects expose students to social science, religion, foreign languages and mathematics. This enables them to develop a storehouse of knowledge with a wide range yielding particularly creative solutions to problems in academia and their lives.

#### Serving on Dissertation Committees
As a research faculty member, I have been part of committees for dissertation projects at Old Dominion University (Computational Modeling and Simulation Engineering (CMSE) and Computer Science (CS)). As a committee member I take an active role, especially during proposal preparation as I can contribute to helping students arrive at a specific and grounded problem definition, a major challenge that most graduate students face.
